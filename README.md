# Project 1: Pounds

## Project Description

Pounds provides meal tracking with financial motivators for sticking to daily goals. Users set a Calorie limit through macronutrient goals, then track their meals and snacks. Exceeding goal limits in one day incures a cost—typically on the order of $1—which is held in a seperate, trackable account (third-party) and accessable after long-term goals are met.

## Usage

Once installed, the app begins on a splash screen and moves to user verification. Registration includes a guided process to set up financial incentives. Once logged in, navigation is accomplished through a bottom navigation bar. First, goals should be set and may be later adjusted on the Macros tab. Calories is where new food items are added, and entered items are displayed along with a simple progress bar for the day's calorie intake. In the Progress and Penalties screens, further details are displayed on user activity in the long-term. Promotions provides an opportunity for external brands to market health related services, usually with an incentive like a coupon.
