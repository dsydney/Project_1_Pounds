# Project 1: Pounds

## Project Description

Pounds provides meal tracking with financial motivators for sticking to daily goals. Users set a Calorie limit through macronutrient goals, then track their meals and snacks. Exceeding goal limits in one day incures a cost—typically on the order of $1—which is held in a seperate, trackable account (third-party) and accessable after long-term goals are met.
